# whet
Aquarium controller for raspberry pi and PCA9685
Developing on pi 3B

Written in python.
Using things like sockjs, tornado, liking websockets and probably some javascript coming up, still making up my mind.


Features:
Dimming - constant current led drivers that are dimmable via pwm signal.
Maybe doing relays.
